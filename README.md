## ⚠️ Project Status

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main directories:

### 1. `/Project Code`

This folder contains all the Python scripts and notebooks related to the core analysis of the project.

* `SharkRisk_Notebook.ipynb`: This is the main notebook for the project and contains our most developed analysis.
* `/drafts`: This sub-directory holds various exploratory notebooks, code trials, and experimental approaches. These files are not part of the final pipeline but are saved for reference.

### 2. `/Reports & Generation Notebooks`

This folder contains the final deliverables (reports) and the notebooks used to create them.

* **Report Generation Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks used to generate the data, visualizations, and text for the final reports (e.g., `CollaborationReportGeneration.ipynb`, `ReportGeneration.ipynb`).
* Contains all images that were generated and included in the final reports.
* **PDF Reports:** The final submitted versions of the **Collaboration Report** and the **Final Report** in PDF format.
